**BHAGAT SINGH**
====

**Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931)** was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officerin what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.
 
 He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.
 Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.
